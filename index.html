<!--Vue: Show/Hide
Requirements:
1. Create a HTML page with four images of your choice. For example,
images of you or your pet at different ages
2. Using Vue.js library, provide the following functionality. When you
hover over the image it will change from a current image to a earlier
one (example baby /teenage picture).
3. Add any other feature or event that demonstrates your knowledge of
Vue.js
To ensure a good grade, add additional work to style the page and form
elements. Just be sure to provide original work for all aspects of the assignment.
A video showing a working example will be shared in the Class Discussion ->
Common Area forum. This will help you clearly understand the desired features
and behavior of the script. -->
